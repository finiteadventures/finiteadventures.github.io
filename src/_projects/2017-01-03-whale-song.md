I've always loved picture books, graphic novels - illustrated books of any kind... I've spent countless lost hours in the buttered-toast bearing groves of [Patrick](http://amzn.to/2kEnDzN) and the under-sink caverns of [Okilele](http://amzn.to/2lBXss1). I've always wanted to create illustrated books of my own. After so many aborted attempts and half-finished projects, I finally finished a picture book.

This is __Whale Song__, my first picture book, and hopefully not my last. I'm particularly proud of the illustrations, which were a labour of love, each one hand coloured in my favourite brush tipped markers (shout out to Faber Castell's ever wonderful artist brush pens).
