I spent a year writing a-poem-a-day. At times, it was a turbulent adventure of late night scrawlings, phrases unearthed from the dregs of midnight cups of tea, poems desperately scribbled on the nearest scrap before running out of the house, late for work as ever. At other moments, it was a journey into the sublime, teaching me to see beauty, inspiration and possibility in small seemingly insignificant moments of life.

As the year progressed, I felt myself growing into my writing, like a fledgling into her wings. Before that year I had written when inspiration had taken me, now inspired or otherwise, I had to write, and slowly I developed the discipline to do so. Writing took up a permanent slot in my subconscious, and I trawled each day for ideas, collecting snippets in a series of spiral-bound notebooks.

I noticed themes emerging from the growing set of poems. Into stories of love, joy and sexuality, I wove tales of innocence and its loss - a loss which can be enriching, tragic, or simultaneously both. In the arc of my own life, I had long felt that I grappled with the conflicting pull of the novel and unknown against the comfort and security of the familiar, and I saw that struggle reflected in the poems I wrote.

 As common themes emerged, it made sense gather connected pieces and polish them into a collection. Meet __The Unfinished House__, a slim volume of poems assembled from that strange and adventurous year of writing a poem every day. To make this chapbook really special, I have hand-bound each copy in thrifted wallpaper and illustrated each page with my own delicate black and white line art.

__The Unfinished House__ is named for my parent's never finished house. Growing up among its eccentric electrics and leaky plumbing, I came to see life reflected in its eternal construction. We have each taken ownership of a tiny portion of this immense existence. Some days we plaster a new wall, other days the roof caves in. And it all returns to nature in the end.

Will you have tea with me?
