Actually the adventures began along time ago. When the universe was small but mighty. When a single cell divided into two. When the first loaf of really good bread was baked. When Vikings sailed the ocean blue. When humans walked on the moon. But I'm not here to talk about those adventures, I'm here to tell you about the finite adventures of one small human being known as Sarah. (That's me.)

I was born in Dublin in a small and often ramshackle house, to a small and sometimes ramshackle family.

Hello fellow adventurer! Maybe you know me, maybe you don't.

A few years ago, I tried to make my way as a writer, artist and designer. I wrote a whole lot of poems, drew constantly, ran a spoken word event. I started getting my work out into the world - but I was plagued with self doubt to the point of panic, and that and the constant financial struggle took a toll on me physically and psychologically. I turned to web development because I liked it and it promised financial stability. Web development is awesome (and I love having it as part of my creative arsenal), but working full time has left little time and even less energy for the creative work that has such fundamental / essential importance to me, that I feel so deeply invested in.

If you have loved my work, if it has brought you joy, if it has made you smile or cry or feel something deep deep in your chest, I'm asking you now to give a little something back. There are so many ways you can give. First and foremost, you could join my party of adventurers on Patreon and sponsor my work on a monthly basis. The more sponsorship I receive the closer I can get to my goal of devoting myself full time to my creative work, and the more time I can devote to making more things that (I hope) will give you even more joy.

Having spent plenty of my life as a starving artist, I totally understand however if you cannot afford a monthly sponsorship. There are a whole bunch of other ways you can support me. Consider buying one of my books. I also have a whole lot of gorgeous merchandise available through Redbubble.

If that's still beyond your budget, how about signing up for my mailing list. How about following me on social media. Even better, spread the word about my finite adventures! Tell your friends about my work.

And let me thank you in advance.
